EulerPrimalityTest
==================
This repo contains codes for computing the Jacobi symbol and executing the Solovay-Strassen primality test to which I refer as [Euler Primality test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solovay%E2%80%93Strassen_primality_test) because it uses the [Euler criterion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_criterion).



JacobiSymbol.js and JacobiSymbol1.js are two different ways of computing the [Jacobi symbol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_symbol) in javascript.

JacobiSymbol code was developed by Fred Richman. I retrieved and modified the code from:

JacobiSymbol1 code was developed by Peter Strandmark in Matlab language. I retrieved, converted to javascipt, and modified the code from:
