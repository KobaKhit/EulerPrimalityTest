EulerPrimalityTest
==================
This repo contains codes for computing the Jacobi symbol and executing the Solovay-Strassen primality test to which I refer as Euler Primality test because it uses the Euler criterion.

Euler criterion:

JacobiSymbol and JacobiSymbol1 are two different ways of computing the Jacobi symbol in javascript.

Jacobi symbol:

JacobiSymbol code was developed by Fred Richman. I retrieved and modified the code from:

JacobiSymbol1 code was developed by Peter Strandmark in Matlab language. I retrieved, converted to javascipt, and modified the code from:
